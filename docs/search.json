I work with Dr. Nathan Kraft’s plant community ecology group.\n\n​My research focuses on how seed dispersal shapes plant communities. I combine field data with ecological modeling to investigate how species-specific dispersal influences biodiversity locally and across landscapes.\n\nI earned my B.S. in Plant Biology from UC Davis with minors in Professional Writing and Ecology, Evolution, & Biodiversity. There, I also completed my California Naturalist certification, which kickstarted my love for community science. You can find me documenting every organism I see on iNaturalist, eBird, or a number of other community science platforms."
